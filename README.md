# NanoEngine (Forked from SheeeshEngine)

Welcome to Nano Engine, a custom 3D engine designed for the 3D engine subject of the degree in Design and Development of Video Games in CITM. This ReadMe provides an overview of the engine's features and how to use them effectively.

This is a fork of the original "Sheeesh Engine" repository created by two students from CITM-UPC Terrassa, Xiao Costajussà Bellver & Oriol Martín Corella. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Urii98/SheeeshEngine).
All additional functionalities starting from Sheeesh Engine version 0.1 have been added by me.
